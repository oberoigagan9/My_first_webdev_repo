        <p>Hi, I'm Gagandeep Singh. I'm learning web development , and enhancing my skills to build up a website that showcases my portfolio. I would like to further use it for blog writing or make a new wensite for blog writing and enhance my writing skills . I love anime and manga and everything technology, so I'll most probably be writing about recommendations and latest technology , I always wanted to pursue writing a blog as a hobby</p>
